# myweatherapp
AngularJS 1 with Google Map and open weather API 
Demo:
- http://shadkhan.in/myprojects/CompuCorpWeather/app/index.html

This is simple weather app that load Cities from Google Map using vs-autocomplete plugin and fetch the weather from open weather api

This one is without Grunt package you can directly run it under your server, I will create separate one with Node and Grunt with dependency.

To run this app you need a webserver 
If you have python installed run the below command in myweatherapp folder
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Browser : localhost:8000/index.html

If you dont have python and dont have webserver (localhost) installed , so easiest way to runn webserver add the plugin in Chrome

after adding it in your Chrome browser just choose the app folder and you are good to go.
